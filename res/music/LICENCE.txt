The "click" sound was made by PHILIIPUS Shakespeare. I have personal permission to use that sound.

This program also uses self-written music and sounds created with Bosca Ceoil (https://boscaceoil.net/):
- "aqua" (aka background music)
- "intro"
- "win" based on the "Valhalla" leitmotif from "Das Rheingold" (1853) by Richard Wagner (1813 - 1883)
